# Etch-a-Sketch

This etch-a-sketch allows users to choose the number of squares in their grid via a button that will generate a prompt.

I ensure that the grid is generated in the same total space as before by using a fixed width and determining the flex-basis of each square with a simple division.

Each square listens for users to enter it with their mouse and generates a random background color using the Math library to generate 3 random RGB values.
